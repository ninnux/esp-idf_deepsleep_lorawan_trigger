**The Things Network device library for ESP-IDF (ESP32) supporting devices with Semtech SX127x chips**

This ESP32 component provides LoRaWAN communication with [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). It supports

- OTAA (over-the-air activation)
- uplink and downlink messages
- saving the EUIs and key in non-volatile memory
- [AT commands](https://github.com/manuelbl/ttn-esp32/wiki/AT-Commands) for provisioning EUIs and key (so the same code can be flashed to several devices)
- support for regions Eurpe, North America, Australia, Asia and India

The library is based on the LMIC library from IBM (specifically the version maintained by MCCI â€“ see their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic)) and provides a high-level API specifically targeted at The Things Network.
